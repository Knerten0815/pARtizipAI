# Study Project on Participatory Urban Design

The goal of this project is a proof of concept application for turning physical miniature building, created by people on the street with predefined building blocks, into digital representations of such buildings, to further detail their appearence and give people the chance to participate in urban design and planning.

## Concept

In the process of conceptualisation we developed four steps, which encapsulate different problems:

### 1. Physical
Building Blocks that can be placed and arranged on a table by our participants

### 2. Scan
A way to identify the different building blocks and produce a virtual representation

### 3. Detail
Customize the digital building with different materials and further structural pieces as well as decorations

### 4. Preview
A way to look at a finished building either from a different perspective or via AR in the physical world

## Vuforia Engine
Vuforia is a Unity Plugin, which provides solutions for tracking objects in AR applications.

We utilize the Vuforia Engine to bridge the gap between physical building blocks and our virtual Unity environment.
