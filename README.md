# Study Project on Participatory Urban Design

The goal of this project is a proof of concept application for turning physical miniature building, created by people on the street with predefined building blocks, into digital representations of such buildings, to further detail their appearence and give people the chance to participate in urban design and planning.

### Vuforia Engine
Vuforia is a Unity Plugin, which provides solutions for tracking objects in Augmented Reality (AR) applications.

We utilize the Vuforia Engine to bridge the gap between physical building blocks and our virtual Unity environment.
